# About
A site explaining the different DNA tests available to consumers in simple terms. Includes a paternal haplogroup (genetic lineage based on the Y-chromosome) predictor tool. 

The haplogroup prediction feature allows users to select the region where their known paternal ancestry originates from in the world. The results show which group they likely belong to. The predictions are based on academic studies and relies on a JSON file serving as a database.
