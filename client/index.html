        <p>DNA is a tiny molecule that is found in nearly all cells in our body. Similar to computer code, it contains the instructions for building the proteins that make up our body.</p>

        <p>The human genome contains some <strong>6.4 billion base pairs(!)</strong>. Sequencing the first human genome originally cost over $3 billion. Today, that price has been brought down to below $300. We've come a long way!</p>

            <h2>Ancestry DNA Tests</h2>
            <p>DNA tests geared toward ancestry are divided into 3 main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autosomal DNA (auDNA):</strong> This test provides a regional breakdown of where your ancestors likely lived in the past. Typically companies need to only sequence select portions of your DNA, since human beings are 99.9% identical in their genetic makeup!</li>
                <li><strong>Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA):</strong> All of us trace our lineage back to <strong>genetic Adam</strong>, our great-great-great... grandfather. But since humanity "left its nest" thousands of years ago, we branched into separate branches. To find which paternal lineage you belong to, you can take a Y-DNA test if you're a male (since only males have a Y-chromosome), or have a male relative take it if you're a female.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):</strong> All humans share a mother from the very distant past — <strong>genetic Eve</strong>. To find which maternal lineage you belong to, you can take an mtDNA test. Both females and males have a mitochondrial DNA.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="test-explanation" id="health-breakdown">
            <h2>Health DNA Tests</h2>
            <p>Since our DNA serves as a blueprint for constructing the building blocks of our bodies, analyzing it provides some interesting and crucial biological information. These may include traits such as eye color or lactose intolerance, but also a potential predisposition to certain diseases. Detection of particular gene mutations may indicate an increased risk. However, it's important to note that genetic makeup is not the most important factor. The environment in which an individual lives is just as important, if not more so.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Armed with the knowledge of genetic risks, a person can adjust their lifestyle accordingly to prevent contracting diseases for which they may be at greater risk proactively.</p>

        <div class="test-explanation" id="wgs-breakdown">
            <h2>Whole Genome Sequence</h2>
            <p>If you are interested in <i>both</i> the ancestry aspect and analysis that is useful for health purposes, a <strong>Whole Genome Sequence (WGS)</strong> is recommended. This test is more comprehensive than an Autosomal test used for either ancestry or select health markers. While is is more costly, it is considered "medical grade" and can be interpreted by medical professionals for higher fidelity analysis.</p>
